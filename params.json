Check [Selectize](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/)!\r\n\r\n### Browser Support\r\n\r\nShould run wherever Ember and Selectize run.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n\r\nJust grab the `src/ember.selectize.js` and drop/include in your build pipeline.\r\nBuilding automation is not available since this is a very simple project (basically an `Ember.View`).\r\n\r\nThe usage should be very similar to `Ember.Select`. For example, in a template you could write:\r\n```handlebars\r\n{{ view Ember.Selectize id=\"type\"\r\n  contentBinding=\"controller.types\"\r\n  optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\r\n  optionLabelPath=\"content.name\"\r\n  selectionBinding=\"model.type\"\r\n  placeholder=\"Select an option\" }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nOpen `tests/index.html` in a browser.\r\n\r\nTests are written in qunit, and were borrowed from `Ember.Select`.\r\n\r\nI've rewritten many of them, but most of them still fail.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the nature of this component. `Selectize`'s tests assures that everything is ok between Selectize<->DOM.\r\n`Ember.Select`'s tests also test the DOM. This is unecessary in this project. \r\n\r\nEmber-selectize tests should be focused between Ember<->Selectize.\r\n\r\n**There is still much to do here.**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
